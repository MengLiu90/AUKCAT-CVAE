# AUKCAT-CVAE
AUKCAT-CVAE is a conditional variational autoencoder designed to generate high-quality synthetic data to enhance training and generalization of AI models for kcat prediction.

Its underlying algorithm, however, is domain-agnostic and can be applied to any scenario requiring data augmentation for model generalization.
