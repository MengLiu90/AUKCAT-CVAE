# AUKCAT-CVAE
AUKCAT-CVAE is a conditional variational autoencoder designed to generate high-quality synthetic instances to enhance AI model training and generalization.
Its underlying algorithm, however, is domain-agnostic and can be applied to any scenario requiring data augmentation or model generalization.
